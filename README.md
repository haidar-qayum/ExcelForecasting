# Forecasting and Scenario Analysis Project

## Overview

This project utilizes Microsoft Excel to perform advanced forecasting and scenario analysis for a subscription-based business. The primary objectives are to predict future sales, assess upsell opportunities, and analyze the impact of pricing and demand changes on revenue. The project is divided into several key components:

1. **Sales Forecasting**: Utilizes historical sales data to forecast future sales using methods like Simple Moving Average (SMA) and Weighted Moving Average. Additionally, it includes the Exponential Smoothing (ETS) method to provide more accurate forecasts.
   
2. **Upsell Opportunity Analysis**: Evaluates potential upsell opportunities across different subscription types based on conversion rates and historical upsell data.

3. **Scenario Analysis**: Examines the impact of different pricing strategies and demand elasticity on projected sales to support strategic decision-making.

## Skills Gained

- **Data Analysis and Forecasting**: Learned to apply various forecasting methods to predict future sales trends. Gained experience using Excel functions to manipulate data and calculate forecasts.
- **Scenario Planning**: Acquired skills in conducting scenario analysis to evaluate the effects of different variables on business outcomes.
- **Data Visualization**: Enhanced the ability to create insightful charts and graphs to communicate findings clearly and effectively.
- **Advanced Excel Functions**: Improved proficiency in using a range of Excel functions and tools for data analysis, including PivotTables, forecasting functions, and various lookup functions.

## Functions and Tools Used

### Excel Functions

- **`FORECAST.ETS`**: Used to predict future values based on a time series using the Exponential Smoothing (ETS) algorithm, providing a robust forecasting model that accounts for seasonality.
- **`FORECAST.ETS.CONFINT`**: Calculates the confidence interval for a forecasted value, offering a range of potential future sales figures to understand forecast reliability.
- **`SUMIF`, `AVERAGEIF`, `COUNTIF`**: Used to perform conditional calculations based on a single criterion, such as summing or averaging sales data for a specific subscription type, or counting occurrences of specific conditions in the dataset.
- **`SUMIFS`, `COUNTIFS`**: Applied for conditional calculations with multiple criteria, allowing for more complex data analysis, such as summing upsell amounts across multiple conditions like date ranges and subscription types.
- **`IF` and `VLOOKUP`**: Used for conditional logic and data retrieval, respectively, to enhance data analysis and automation within the Excel models.
- **Nested `IF` statements**: Implemented to perform complex logical checks and return results based on multiple conditions, enhancing decision-making processes within data analysis and forecasting models.

### Excel Tools

- **Series Filling**: Utilized to quickly populate data ranges with sequential data, such as dates or numeric sequences, to ensure consistent time series analysis.
- **What-IF Analysis: Scenario Manager**: Used to analyze and compare different scenarios by changing multiple variables simultaneously, providing insights into the impact of various business decisions on outcomes.
- **What-IF Analysis: Goal Seek**: Applied to find the necessary input value required to achieve a desired result, such as determining the sales target needed to reach a specific revenue goal.
- **What-IF Analysis: Data Table**: Created to explore different outcomes based on varying input values, enabling sensitivity analysis and better understanding of the relationship between different variables.
- **Forecast Sheet**: Employed to automate the creation of a forecast and visualize historical data along with future predictions, simplifying the process of forecasting future trends based on past performance.
- **Data Visualization Tools**: Utilized Excel's charting tools to create line charts, area charts, conditioning for visualizing trends, forecasts, and scenario analyses.

- **Outcome**: Identified high-value upsell opportunities across different customer segments, helping to focus marketing and sales efforts.

### 3. **Scenario Analysis**

- **Objective**: Understand the impact of different pricing and demand scenarios on projected sales and revenue.
- **Methods Used**:
  - Created a sensitivity analysis table to explore how changes in price and demand elasticity affect sales.
  - Used heatmaps to visualize the impact of different scenarios on revenue.

- **Visualization**: The table and heatmap below illustrate the elasticity of demand and the projected sales for various pricing strategies.
